# fMRI datasets for NLP

Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for measuring brain activity. It detects the changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity: When a brain region is more active it consumes more oxygen, and to meet this increased demand blood flow increases to the active area. fMRI can be used to produce activation maps of the brain regions involved in a particular mental process.
