# Electroencephalography (EEG) datasets for NLP

EEG is the physiological method of choice to record the electrical activity generated by the brain via electrodes placed on the scalp surface. It measures electrical activity generated by the synchronized activity of thousands of neurons (in volts). provides excellent time resolution, allowing you to detect activity within cortical areas - even at sub-second timescales. This allows for word-level signal segmentation.

This collection contains EEG datasets recording stimuli of the following languages:
