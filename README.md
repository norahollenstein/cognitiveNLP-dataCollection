# Collection of available data sources for cognitively-inspired NLP

This growing collection of cognitive data sources of human language processing tries to provide a list of datasets useful for NLP researchers interested in cognitively-inspired NLP. It includes data of cognitive processing during language understanding. Data sets for language production/speech synthesis are not (yet) included in this repo.

If you have any questions or suggestions to expand this collection, please contact me: noraho@ethz.ch

This list contains datasets of the following recording modalities:

## Eye tracking

An eye tracker measures eye positions and eye movement. Gaze patterns are an indirect measument of cognitive processes ocurring during reading. There are many available eye-tracking corpora in multple languages that can be used for NLP purposes. See the list [here](https://github.com/norahollenstein/cognitiveNLP-dataCollection/tree/master/eye-tracking#eye-tracking-datasets-for-nlp).

## Electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG measures voltage fluctuations through the scalp. It has high temporal resolution. The list of EEG datasets for NLP can be found [here](https://github.com/norahollenstein/cognitiveNLP-dataCollection/tree/master/eeg#electroencephalography-eeg-datasets-for-nlp).

## Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. It is slow, but has very high spatial resolution.
This repo contains a [list of fMRI datasets](https://github.com/norahollenstein/cognitiveNLP-dataCollection/tree/master/fmri#functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging) useful for NLP in various languages.
